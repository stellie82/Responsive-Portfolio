                    <p>Aloha, and welcome to my page!</p>
                    <p>This bootcamp will be quite the journey for me.  I have always studied math and science but never anything like programming.  Luckily, there are similarities and I am hoping my skills can push me through this course.  It's not that I am bored with work, but I have found that some aspects of it get me wondering more.  So here I am exploring my curiosity with you folks and I hope to build some cool things along the way.</p>
                    <p>More about me... I am a full-time employee and mom to a sweet, adventurous 5 year old.  I love the outdoors, especially hiking here in the northwest, as well as running and yoga.  As mentioned early on, I recently finished hiking the Wonderland Trail and would love to summit Rainier next year.  I am also getting married in September and am planning on hiking the Dolomites as a honeymoon after this course is done.</p>
                    <p>Feel free to reach out to me.  I would love to share ideas and get to know you.</p>
